            <h1>OC UIL COMP SCI PRACTICE SITE</h1>
            <hr>
            Hello and welcome to the OC UIL Computer Science practice site. If you are reading this, my memory lives on!
            The
            purpose of this site is to contain a large variety of computer science UIL problems for quick practice
            before
            meets. These problems are catagorized for your solving pleasure, and tackle a wide range of topics!

            <h2>The Problems</h2>
            The problems contained in this project are from all levels of UIL Computer science tests. They are pulled
            from
            the collection of tests found within the zip folder in this project.

            <h2>The Topics</h2>
            The topics that can be practiced are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tracing: Practice going through algorithms by hand. These algorithms are non-recursive and mostly
                    deal
                    with order of operations and mathematics as opposed to data structures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recursion: Practice recursive problems. These functions will contain calls to themselves --- Very
                    scary!</li>
                <li>
                    Mathematics / Number: Practice your base skills and java mathematics knowledge
                </li>
            </ul>
