# OC UIL COMP SCI PRACTICE SITE
___
Hello and welcome to the OC UIL Computer Science practice site. If you are reading this, my memory lives on! The purpose of this site is to contain a large variety of computer science UIL problems for quick practice before meets. These problems are catagorized for your solving pleasure, and tackle a wide range of topics!

## The Problems
The problems contained in this project are from all levels of UIL Computer science tests. They are pulled from the collection of tests found within the zip folder in this project. 

## The Topics
The topics that can be practiced are as follows:
* Tracing: Practice going through algorithms by hand. These algorithms are non-recursive and mostly deal with order of operations and mathematics as opposed to data structures.
* Recursion: Practice recursive problems. These functions will contain calls to themselves --- Very scary!
* Mathematics / Number: Practice your base skills and java mathematics knowledge
